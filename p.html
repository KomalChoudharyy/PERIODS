  <p>According to statistics, half of the female population of India are not aware of the Menstruation. Most of the people in India consider this menstruation to be  as taboo and most of them consider this to be as disease. Being literate , people of India are often ashamed of talking in the public area or with family members or with people of opposite sex. During puberty, when girls should talk on menstrual cycle  with their parents , they are ashamed of having this conversation even with their friends. Living in 21st century ,in the era of social media ,people should spread awareness regrading menstruation , hygiene ,myth ,facts etc. Parents should make that bond with their child so that they must be  open regarding these subjects and  may  not suffer from any  kind of infection or uterus cancer in future. Not even girls, boys should also know on the menstruation. So, lets spread some awareness among people so that people should understand this menstruation is not a curse on human body but a blessing on human .
